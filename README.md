# Two Players Solitaire

This will be a multiplayer card game, akin to the solitaire genre, playable via browser.  
The ruleset is inspiered by [karanos-solitaire](https://rokasv.itch.io/karanos-solitaire)  
The code is forked from an other [unfinished project](https://github.com/Redoxee/Wist)  

I will try to code as much as possible in a single solution with a .Net5.0 server and a html/css/js front end.  
The goal is to keep the project light in dependecies, although I'm not entierly closed to the idea of using tools if I find them usefull enough.

About me:  
I'm Anton, I mostly make games, both in my [free time](https://antonmakesgames.itch.io/) and in my professional time.  
I often don't finish my personal projects, but I hope this one has a scope small enough that I can reach a satifying point before running out of motivation.
