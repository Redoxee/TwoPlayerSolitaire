# Two Players Solitaire

This will be a multiplayer card game, akin to the solitaire genre, playable via browser.  
The ruleset is inspiered by [karanos-solitaire](https://rokasv.itch.io/karanos-solitaire)  
The code is forked from an other [unfinished project](https://github.com/Redoxee/Wist)  

I will try to code as mush as possible in a single solution with a .Net Core 3.1 server and a html/css/js front end.  
The goal is to keep the project light in dependecies although I'm not entierly closed from the idea of using tools if I find them usefull enough.
