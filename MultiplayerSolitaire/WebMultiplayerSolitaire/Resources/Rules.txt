Two player solitaire is a versus game.
Your goal is to win two rounds.
To win a round, reduce your opponent health to 0 or have more health when the deck is empty.
On your turn choose a card from your hand (bottom row) and place it on your board (middle row).
Covered cards go back into the deck.
Make combo to Damage, Heal, Impede your opponent.

Chain : One damage to the opponent.
Flush : Heal one health point.
Pair  : Shuffle the oposing cards into the deck.
Royal (Chain + Flush) : Two damage to the opponent.

Order isn't important to make combos.
Chain can loop : 10 1 2 is a chain.

Good Luck!
